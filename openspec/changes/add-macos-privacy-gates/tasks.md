## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Define a macOS networked-services prompt and flags in install.sh.
- [ ] 1.2 Gate Tailscale install behind the macOS networked-services opt-in.
- [ ] 1.3 Gate Node-RED (and similar services) in npm global package install lists.
- [ ] 1.4 Ensure Copyparty remains installed regardless of opt-in choice.
- [ ] 1.5 Update summary output to reflect skipped networked services.
